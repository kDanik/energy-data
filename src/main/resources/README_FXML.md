## main.fxml

This project uses JavaFX library FXML to simplify creation of GUI.


File (main.fxml) can be edited directly or using visual editors such as SceneBuilder (free, open-source) or any other alternative.
When editing file with SceneBuilder, open file directly, to prevent accidental inconsistencies.

Please pay attention to version of javafx / fxml of this project vs version in used version,
using different versions can result into inconsistencies and errors.
